The core functionality of Spring Data REST is to export resources for Spring Data repositories.
Spring Data REST exposes sub-resources of every item resource for each of the associations the item resource has. By default, Spring Data REST uses HAL (hypertext application language) to render responses.

RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration - the @Configuration for Spring Data REST
RepositoryRestConfigurerAdapter - used to customize the configuration

By default, Spring Data REST serves up REST resources at the root URI, "/". Register a @Bean which extends RepositoryRestConfigurerAdapter and overwrite configureRepositoryRestConfiguration in order to change it. With spring boot use spring.data.rest.basePath=/new-base-path-for-spring-data-rest in application.properties.
http://ip:port/base-path-for-spring-data-rest returns a JSON with the first level of resources provided with Spring Data REST.

@RepositoryRestResource - used on a Repository interface to customize the path and name of the resource
@RestResource - used on a method to customize the path and name of the exported resource; use exported = false in order not to export the resource

Annotation org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.Projection used to define altered views for entities (e.g.: not showing the password for user).
URI would look like: http://localhost:8080/persons/1?projection=noPassword
@Projection can be used with SpEL expression to create new properties.
An excerpt is a projection that is applied to a resource collection automatically, e.g.:
@RepositoryRestResource(excerptProjection = NoPassword.class)
interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository {}

Validation is achived using a registered org.springframework.validation.Validator instance:
a. beforeCreatePersonValidator -> prefix the bean name with the Data REST event name
b. assigning Validators manually -> override RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration.configureValidatingRepositoryEventListener and add the validators

Events: BeforeCreateEvent, AfterCreateEvent, BeforeSaveEvent, AfterSaveEvent, BeforeLinkSaveEvent, AfterLinkSaveEvent, BeforeDeleteEvent, AfterDeleteEvent. Writing an ApplicationListener:
a. extend AbstractRepositoryEventListener (onBeforeSave, etc) -> makes no distinction based on the type of the entity
b. write an annotated handler -> @RepositoryEventHandler on class and @HandleBeforeSave on method (first parameter determines the domain type whose events youâ€™re interested)

Creating links from Spring MVC controllers to Spring Data REST resources is possible with injectable RepositoryEntityLinks (equivalent to EntityLinks from Spring HATEOAS): entityLinks.linkToCollectionResource(Person.class).

ALPS (Application-Level Profile Semantics) is a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics.
ALPS (application/alps+json or application/schema+json) -> used for metadata provided by a Spring Data REST-based application.
http://ip:port/base-path-for-spring-data-rest/profile -> metadata location
ALPS list first entity's attributes (+ projections) then operations.

Spring security works fine with Spring Data REST; just use @PreAuthorize as usual.

The developer of the HAL spec has a useful application: the HAL Browser.

Write a custom handler (overriding Spring Data REST response handlers) for a specific resource using @RepositoryRestController (instead of @RestController). There's a custom HandlerMapping instance that responds only to the RepositoryRestController which is considered before the one for @Controller or @RestController.

Use ResourceProcessor interface in order to provide links to other resources from a particular entity. You declare spring beans implementing ResourceProcessor for a specific entity.
If you register your own ConversionService in the ApplicationContext and register your own Converter, then you can return a Resource implementation of your choosing.
